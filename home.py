         #### Situation
         Global market competition demands efficient supply chain management.

         #### Task
         Improve supply chain operations through advanced analytics and modeling.

         #### Action
         - Phase 1: Data Analysis
         Data cleaning and preprocessing.
         Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   
         - Phase 2: Modeling
         Cost optimization (Linear Regression).
   
         #### Tools and Techniques
         Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
         Data visualization (Power BI).

         #### Result
         - Optimal production volume: 104
         -  Minimized manufacturing cost: $44.93
         - Model performance: Moderate (MSE=858.72, R2=-0.07)

           #### EDA Key Findings
           - **Defect Rates**: Haircare products have the highest defect rate (2.48%), followed by skincare (2.33%) and cosmetics (1.92%).
           - **Supply Chain Risk**: Top 10 highest-risk SKUs are primarily due to high lead times and low stock levels.
           - **Inventory Optimization**: EOQ analysis suggests optimal order quantities vary significantly across SKUs.
           - **Customer Segmentation**: Female customers generate highest average revenue ($6,095) for skincare products.
           - **Lead Time Optimization**: Sea transportation mode has the shortest average lead time (12.18 days).
           - **Best Route**: Route A has the shortest average lead time (14.7 days).

           #### Recommendations
            - Improve quality control measures for haircare products.
            - Implement risk mitigation strategies for high-risk SKUs.
            - Optimize inventory levels based on EOQ analysis.
            - Target female customers with personalized marketing campaigns.
            - Prioritize sea transportation mode for faster delivery.
            - Utilize Route A for efficient logistics.
           #### Future Analysis

            - Conduct root cause analysis for high defect rates.
            - Develop predictive models for demand forecasting.
            - Analyze cost savings from optimized inventory levels.
            - Investigate customer demographics' impact on purchasing behavior.
            - Evaluate sustainability implications of transportation modes.
